#AS 2nd tic tac toe pseudocode

game loop
   while True:

       ask if player want to play X or O
       if they play X:

       or if they play O:
           robot goes first
       else:

                    tie

turns keep looping until game ends in win, loss, or tie
W will represent both player and both
possible ways to lose or win:

example of tie:

    board_list3[(X), (O), (O)]

                if player wins:

                ask if player wants to play again
                    if yes:
